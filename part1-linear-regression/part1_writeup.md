# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
R Squared value: 0.63
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
Predicted blood pressure for age 42: 136.52
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?        
It is not very accurate because blood pressure changes constantly and you would need much more information and everyone's body is different. More trails would definitely improve the model and accuracy.
