# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
around .86 meaning 86% accuracy 
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
Model is pretty accurate since 86% accuracy is solid but not really good. 
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
Model predicts $10,601 and 20 yers is $2800
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
Data has longer ages of cars and variations in mileages
